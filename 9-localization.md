# Localization

![](.gitbook/assets/posts01-multivoila.jpg)

Based on the SFM results, we can perform camera localization and retrieve the motion of an animated camera in the scene of the 3D reconstruction.

## Camera Calibration

To retrieve focal length, principal point, and distortion parameter, the camera parameters are calibrated from multiple views.

## Single Camera Localization



## Rig of Camera
